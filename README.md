**In recent years, with the popularization of mobile electronic devices, the problem of myopia in children and adolescents has become the focus of public health attention. In order to effectively supervise the eye behavior of children and adolescents, especially the habit of watching TV, this paper proposes a TV watching behavior analysis system based on OpenCV. The system realizes real-time monitoring of users' TV viewing behavior through face collection, detection, recognition, and estimation of head posture and distance. The system is developed in Python language, combined with OpenCV and Dlib library for face feature extraction and motion detection, and PyQt5 is used to build a user-friendly graphical interface. Experimental results show that the system can accurately recognize faces and estimate head postures, which has high accuracy and real-time performance for judging whether users are watching TV. This study provides a new technical means for video-based supervision of TV watching behavior.
